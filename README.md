# Workout Generator

The other day I went on a walk to think about what my fitness goals are for 2024. Two things emerged from this walk: that my goal is to set my half-marathon PR and that I should TOTALLY write a script to select which exercise I do on my high intensity day and on my Choose-Your-Own-Adventure day. This repo is the implementation of the second idea.

As of now, the script selects a random choice from a list of workout ideas stored in a text file and prints out the selection. For my current purposes, this all I need it to do. However, I might consider trying to generate the actual workout as well. Like, if 'Swimming' is selected as the activity then a swimming workout generator will spit out something like "8x50m".
